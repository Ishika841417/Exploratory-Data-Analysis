# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
This project is focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The aim is to work with raw datasets, clean and preprocess the data, and then analyze it through various statistical and visualization techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and meaningful insights. The project makes use of popular Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis. The files are organized in a structured way, with separate sections for datasets, scripts, and outputs, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
The analysis process involves handling missing values and outliers, generating summary statistics, studying distributions, and identifying correlations between different variables. A variety of visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and trend charts, are included to make the findings more understandable and insightful. The project can be easily run by cloning the repository, installing the dependencies listed in the requirements file, and opening the Jupyter notebooks.
This project is a starting point for understanding how to approach EDA systematically and can be further extended by adding advanced analytics, building dashboards using Plotly, Streamlit, or Dash, or even applying machine learning models for predictive insights. It is a useful resource for learners and practitioners who want to strengthen their skills in data analysis and visualization
